body_ik.*

  A set of rigs demonstrating complicated rig subclassing and interaction by
  providing extra IK controls for knees and elbows, which when enabled move the
  hip/shoulder to maintain the control position. The leg rigs must be used in
  tandem with the provided spine rig, and the arms with the shoulder.
